In the month of Shravan, piligrims flock to the temple for the annual pilgrimage known as Temblai yatra (jatra) where people from far off areas of Kolhapur and Belgaum district arrive to worship the Goddess. Every year during Navratri, on the fifth day of Lalitapanchami, a palkhi procession is taken from the Mahalaxmi temple to Temblai mandir at Temblai hill. As of 2013, over 1 million devotees visited the temple during Navratri festival.

Hongqi CA72

The Hongqi CA72 is a car produced by FAW Hongqi. It was the Hongqi's first production automobile and the first representative sedan that was constructed and built in China. Produced from 1958 to 1965, the CA72 was only available to state institutions and the leadership of the Communist Party of China and was regularly used in public events until the 1970s. Numerous details about technology and production are unclear.

The Hongqi CA72 was developed by First Automotive Works (FAW) based in Changchun, which was founded in 1953 with technical and financial support from the Soviet Union. First and foremost, FAW primarily produced commercial vehicles, in particular heavy trucks based on the Soviet model. In 1958, the Great Leap Forward began in China, aimed at catching up China's gap to the western industrialized countries. The effects of this initiative were also felt in the automotive sector. From 1958, several Chinese plants began constructing passenger cars for civilian use. One of the first cars was the FAW-developed middle-class sedan Dongfeng CA71, which was basically a replica of the French Simca Vedette. At this time, FAW also began to develop representative vehicles for the top politicians. The initiative for this was said to have come from the party leader Mao Zedong himself, who had expressed the wish in 1955, at the CPC congress, to replace Soviet limousines driving in with a car from national production.

In August 1958, the first prototype of a saloon was completed. FAW gave the car the model name Hongqi, referring to the revolutionary symbol of the Red Flag.

The first prototype corresponded in the dimensions and in the basic technical structures already the later production model. In the body area, however, there were significant differences. The prototype was a wide chrome strip on the sides of the car. Above the rear wheels was a large air intake, the edge of which was also chrome plated. The fan-shaped grille was very narrow at the bottom and opened far up. These elements accounted for the production version. In automotive literature, the prototype is described as unattractive and coarse. In the following six months, six other prototypes were created, including two four-door convertibles, all of which differed in details from each other and from the later production version.

In 1959, FAW finally began mass production of the now called Hongqi CA72 sedan, which lasted until 1965 or 1967 depending on the source. Until 1962, the CA72 competed with the Beijing Automobile Works produced sedan Beijing CB4, which looked more modern, but ultimately could not prevail. Unlike the CB4, the Hongqi CA72 has been technically improved over the years in details. This affected, among other things, the brakes, which were too weak in the first vehicles. From 1965, the Hongqi was referred to as CA770. Externally and technically, the CA770 was largely identical to the CA72.

Borgoy mutton

Borgoy mutton is a special type of sheep meat grown under specific conditions in the Dzhida valley in the Uorg Borgoy region. Is a meat brand of Buryatia.

In their time, the Borgoysky mutton was delivered to the table of the royal house of the Romanovs. Borgoysky lamb was present on the menu of a solemn dinner on the occasion of the coronation of Nicholas I. In Soviet times, the meat of Dzhida sheep was sold on the Moscow markets with the label "Borgoiskaya lamb". It was sold in the famous Yeliseyevsky grocery store.

Borgoy sheep live in ideal climatic conditions and graze on saline lands. This gives a special taste to well-known not only throughout the republic meat. The value of dishes from meat Borgoy said in a number of books, publications and travel guides.

In Soviet times, the Borgoy mutton was considered one of the best varieties in the country and even had a great demand abroad. Glory Borgoy mutton attracted the attention of Soviet filmmakers, which was filmed the film "The Shepherds Borghoy".

In the area near Beloozersk, which received its name from the location of White Lake next to it, in the spring salt comes out - «"hugir"». Salt from the water in the lake appears, which in itself is very dense in chemical composition. Salt mud has cured properties.

Spring winds salt dust rises into the air and spreads to nearby pastures where sheep graze. And this salt affects sweat on meat, rewarding it with peculiar taste properties.

Research shows that mutton contains more than other types of meat, unsaturated fatty acids, very little cholesterol, a high content of the mineral part. Also in this type of meat there is a sufficient amount of valuable components and trace elements including. easily digestible proteins, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, selenium, vitamins B, E, K, PP, etc.

After the collapse of the USSR and the collapse of the collective farms, the Borgoy mutton brand was threatened with extinction. A change in the botanical composition of grasses in the Borgoy steppes also had a detrimental effect. Currently, active work is underway to preserve and promote this brand. The Dzhida region, where the Borgoi steppe is located, is considered the meat region of the republic.

The Borgoysky Breeding Plant is one of the largest agricultural enterprises in Buryatia. The company is among the leaders in the livestock of Buryat type sheep of the Trans-Baikal fine-fleece breed.

Drum railway station

Drum railway station was opened in January 1854 by the Deeside Railway and served the rural area around Drum Castle estate. The Deeside Railway was taken over by the GNoSR and in 1894 nearby Culter became the terminus for the majority of Aberdeen suburban services with only a few trains continuing through Drum to Banchory. Despite the 1937 closure of many other stations on the Aberdeen suburban service, Drum remained open until 1951 as an intermediate station on the Deeside Railway that ran from Aberdeen (Joint) to Ballater. Drum station was located in Drumoak Parish, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

The first single platformed station was opened in 1854 and stood on the northern side of the line with a level crossing to the west. Doubling of the track took place by 1899 with various alterations made to the station.

The Deeside branch at first was operated by the Deeside Railway. The line became part of the GNoSR and at grouping merged with the London and North Eastern Railway. The line was closed to passengers on 28 February 1966. The line has been lifted and extensive sections form part of the Deeside Way long distance footpath.

The 1854 station only had a short single platform on the later eastbound or northern side of the line with a basic station building. The later wooden station building with ticket office, staff accomodation, waiting area and toilets was of a typical GNoSR design as found at Milltimber, Torphins, Lumphanan and elsewhere on the line.

Track doubling by 1899 resulted in a second platform with a small wooden shelter, a pedestrian overbridge and a small signalbox on the eastbound platform at the eastern end. The level crossing was replaced with a road overbridge at this time. A goods yard was built to the west on the eastbound side of the line, consisting of several sidings, a loading dock and a short siding running to the east. 

By 1964 the main line had been singled with the westbound track lifted, the pedestrian bridge removed, but the stationmaster's house is still shown. Only the eastbound platform was in use by this time. The goods yard track had been lifted.

Suburban services, "subbies", began between Aberdeen and nearby Culter in 1894, calling at all eight intermediate stations in a seven-mile stretch of line in around 20 minutes with a total of around 30 trains every day. The "subbies" service was withdrawn from 5 April 1937 due to competition from bus services. The Aberdeen suburban railway stations were Holburn Street, Ruthrieston, Pitfodels, Cults, West Cults, Murtle, Milltimber and Culter.

The line was however chosen to trial the battery multiple unit and once introduced on 21 April 1958 the train service was doubled to six trains a day and in addition a Sunday service was reinstated.

The station buildings have been demolished but one platform remains with the old westbound shelter in use as a summer house. The Deeside long distance path does not run through station site. The Royal Deeside Railway is located at Milton of Crathes down the line towards Ballater.

The Cortright-Van Patten Mill was a grist mill located at 109 Byron Street in Homer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It was destroyed by fire on May 17, 2010.

THe frst mill in Homer was constructed about 1837 by Leon Barney, and was likely located near the location of the later Cortright-Van Patten Mill. In the 1850s, Cornelius Cuykendall Cortright moved from New York state to Michigan, settling first in Hillsdale County, then Branch County before moving to a location near Homer. In 1886, the original mill burned down. Cortright and his son David formed the firm of C. C. Cortright and Son, and in 1887 had the main main section of this flour mill constructed. The Cortrights hired George A. McCartney of Homer as the contractor. A substantial addition was made to the original mill in about 1910. Cortright's son, David W. Cortright, also owned a farm in the area, and operated the mill in Homer. In 1940, the H. Van Patten Company purchased the mill from the Cortright family, and operated it as a mill until 1970. 

In 1974, the mill was sold to James L. Miller, who converted it into a dinner theater known as "True Grist Ltd." The dinner theater operated under various owners until 1987. In 1996, John and Alice Blakemore purchased the mill and opened a restaurant and banquet hall. in 2006, Lance and Susan Cuffle opened the Homer Mill as a restaurant, bar and haunted house. The mill was destroyed by fire on May 17, 2010.

The Cortright-Van Patten Mill was a rambling frame structure, mixing two-, three-, and four-story sections. The structure was clad in novelty siding. The original 1887 mill had bracketed eaves and dormer-pierced mansard roofs. Later portions, added in about 1910, were gable- and shed-roof sections.

The Halsema Highroad Point also known as the Philippine Pali is a vantage point in Atok, Benguet, Philippines. It is situated on the Halsema Highway.

Located above sea level, it was formerly recognized as the location of the highest point in the Philippine Highway System until 2019 when the high point Kiangan-Tinoc-Buguias Road in Tinoc, Ifugao was recognized as the new holder of the distinction.

The Halsema Highroad Point situated in the barangays of Cattubo and Paoay in Atok, Benguet has been reputed as the highest point in the Philippine Highway System for decades until 2019. It has an elevation of above sea level. The point is situated at the Kilometer 53 mark of Halsema Highway and has a view deck where the towns of Atok, Tublay, Bokod and Kabayan as well as Mount Pulag is visible. It is also known as Philippine Pali due to the resemblance of its vicinity to Pali of Hawaii.

The point lost its official recognition as the highest point in the Philippine Highway System in February 26, 2019 when the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) announced that it has verified the claim of the local government of Tinoc, Ifugao that a portion of the Kiangan-Tinoc-Buguias Road, which was converted into a national road by Republic Act No. 10551 in May 2013, in Mount Gui’ngaw is the highest point in the country's highway system.

Helicopter Brigade of Russian Airborne Troops

The helicopter brigade of Russian Airborne Forces is a plan of the Ministry of Defense of Russia to create a brigade of army aviation as part of the Airborne Forces.

In December 2012, the commander of the airborne troops, Colonel-General Vladimir Shamanov, offered to include army aviation in the composition of the brigade of the Airborne Forces as an experiment.

“We want to propose to include a helicopter regiment in the 31st separate airborne assault brigade: 40 Mi-8 helicopters and 20 Mi-24 helicopters. I emphasize that they are part of the brigade ... It’s difficult to meet us or the General Staff. Over the past 2 years, almost all of our applications for the allocation of army aviation have been met, "said Shamanov at a press conference in Moscow.

Currently, army aviation brigades are organizationally part of the Aerospace Forces. At the same time, they are operatively subordinated to the command of military districts.

In this regard, the commander of the Airborne Forces in order to plan the transfer of units, you must go through a lot of approvals at the level of higher headquarters. Therefore, precious time is lost. In addition, a large number of participants in such negotiations may lead to information leaks. This negates the key factor of the Airborne Forces - surprise.

Another reason: in the conditions of powerful air defense, the most effective is the transfer of troops by helicopter, which is almost imperceptible at ultra-low altitudes. In addition, a helicopter for paratroopers is not only a means of delivery, but also fire support.

That is why it was decided to form its own aircraft in the Airborne Forces - airborne units will be able to use their helicopters without unnecessary delay.

The Ministry of Defense of Russia noted that the proposal to form one air force brigade in the Airborne Forces as a whole was approved. A new brigade is planned to be formed in the next 2-3 years.

For the brigade it is necessary to order new helicopters. According to Izvestia sources, the helicopter brigade will report directly to the commander of the Airborne Forces.

The brigade will consist of 4 helicopter squadrons. The total number is 48–50 helicopters.

One squadron will be equipped with Mi-35M “Super Crocodile” drums - this model, unlike the main attack helicopters Mi-28N and Ka-52, can carry up to seven people of the assault force. Two squadrons will receive in service the transport and combat Mi-8AMTSH-V. Fourth - super heavy Mi-26T2 helicopters.

The brigade will be based either in Ryazan, Voronezh or Orenburg.

Alice Ives Breed

Alice Ives Breed (January 15, 1853 – October 16, 1933) was an American social leader, salonnière, and clubwoman. She excelled as an organizer, using her executive abilities in religious, philanthropic, literary and social channels, aiming to improve the community. 

Breed was conversant with the entire history of the club movement. She was a member of or held leadership positions in the Browning Club, Daughters of the American Revolution, Emergency Association, General Federation of Women's Clubs, Lynn Woman's Club, Massachusetts Society of the Sons and Daughters of Illinois, Massachusetts State Committee of Correspondence of the General Federation of Women's Literary Clubs, North Shore Club, Woman's Auxiliary of the YMCA, Woman's Club House Association, and the
Women's Committee of the World's Congress Auxiliary on moral and social reform.

Alice Ives was born in Pavilion, Illinois, January 15, 1853. Her parents were Franklin Benedict Ives, one of the first pupils to be graduated from the Rush Medical College of Chicago, and Frances M. Luce, his wife. Dr. Ives practiced as a specialist in Chicago, in which city his son and two of his three daughters resided. Mrs. Ives died in 1885. She was descended from a Revolutionary soldier of Connecticut who, when word came to him that there was fighting at Lexington, shouldered his gun and followed Israel Putnam to Massachusetts. Family tradition also claims for her a collateral descent from Ethan Allen, of Ticonderoga. In the 1830s, her paternal grandparents moved with their large family from Chautauqua County, New York, to a little settlement in Illinois known as Franklin Grove. At about the same time, her maternal grandmother, twice widowed, journeyed with her twelve children from Lewis County, New York, for the same destination. These families shared many sentiments in common, being strict Baptists, staunch abolitionists, and strong prohibitionists, and there was much intermarrying between them. 

In 1871, she graduated from Mount Carroll Seminary and of the Frances Shimer School,
and removed to Lynn, Massachusetts.

In 1873, she married Francis William Breed, a prominent shoe manufacturer, who was connected with business interests in Boston and Lynn. Mr. and Mrs. Breed were equally interested in music, art, and literature. They were noted for their hospitality, and were generous supporters of philanthropic work. They traveled extensively. Breed visited every part of the United States, including Alaska. She visited Canada, every country in Europe but Portugal, journeyed in Egypt, and left China in 1898 in order to attend meetings in Denver. She was well-read, and exhibited a sympathy with every movement of her time in the world of music, art and literature. Her home was a center for people distinguished in all those fields. She was an accomplished musician.

For years, Breed served as chairman of the Lynn branch of the Emergency Association. She was the first president of the Woman's Auxiliary of the YMCA at Lynn, an early vice-president of the Lynn Woman's Club, and the first officer to preside over the North Shore Club. She was a member of the Massachusetts State committee for correspondence of the General Federation of Women's Literary Clubs. She was appointed a member of the Women's Committee of the World's Congress Auxiliary on moral and social reform, in 1893. She also served as chairperson of the Massachusetts State Committee of Correspondence, and was a member of it from the time of its formation. In 1896, she was elected vice-president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs. She was an officer of the Woman's Club House Association, where she represented the Browning Club, of Boston, and she served as president in the Massachusetts Society of the Sons and Daughters of Illinois. Breed was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The Breed's family consisted of five children. Their home was in Lynn.

In religion, Breed was of the Bahá'í Faith. In 1918, she served as chair of the Second Session Bahai Congress. She was a resident of New York City at the time.

Breed died October 16, 1933 in Manhattan, and was buried at Pine Grove Cemetery, Lynn, Massachusetts.

Lívio Romano Tragtenberg (born 1961) is a Brazilian musician, composer and record producer.

Tragtenberg was born in São Paulo in 1961, to professor and sociologist Maurício Tragtenberg and actress Beatriz Tragtenberg. On his father's side, he is of German-Jewish descent, and has a brother and a sister. When he was 13 years old he learned by himself how to play the drum kit, leading on to other instruments. During his later youth he met and befriended poets Décio Pignatari and siblings Haroldo and Augusto de Campos, who heavily influenced him, later dropping out from high school to follow a career on music. His debut album, "Ritual", came out in 1980. Later in the 1980s he composed the operas "O. de A. do Brasil" and "O Inferno de Wall Street", based on a poem by 19th-century author Sousândrade, and was a session musician for the 1988 EP "The Early Years", by progressive rock band Violeta de Outono.

Throughout the 1990s to the mid-2000s he continued to release albums, collaborating with Pignatari and Wilson Sukorski, and was a music theory professor for Unicamp from 1990 to 1998. Around the same time he met and befriended filmmaker Tata Amaral, and subsequently composed the soundtrack of many of her films, such as "Um Céu de Estrelas" (1996) and "Hoje" (2011); previously he has also worked with Lúcia Murat in 2000, Joel Pizzini in 2001 and Roberto Moreira in 2004. He also managed the projects Blind Sound Orchestra (which is composed of blind musicians) and the Orquestras de Músicos das Ruas de São Paulo (composed of street musicians of different cultural backgrounds).

In the mid-2010s, Tragtenberg and Rogério Skylab collaborated in a trilogy of albums: "Skylab & Tragtenberg, Vol. 1", "Vol. 2" and "Vol. 3". Skylab once claimed to be a huge fan of Tragtenberg's work, and had previously interviewed him for his talk show "Matador de Passarinho". In 2019, Tragtenberg collaborated again with Skylab by pre-mixing and providing samples for the latter's album "Nas Portas do Cu".

Tragtenberg also authored many books about music theory.

Joseph Harris (trade unionist)

Joseph Harris (born 1866) was an Irish trade unionist and political activist.

Born in Dublin, Harris became a cabinet maker, and moved to Belfast to find work. He joined the Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers, and became prominent in the local trade union movement. In about 1907, he began working full-time as the Irish Organiser of the Workers' Union. He worked with James Larkin to establish branches of the union in Derry, Dundalk, Lisburn and Limerick, and then in 1908 tried to establish one in Dublin. Due to disputes with other unions, he offered to transfer the branches to the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, but Larkin declined. Annoyed by this, Harris became an opponent of Larkin, and worked with James Sexton to get Larkin removed from the Parliamentary Committee of the Irish Trades Union Congress. The union's branches across Ireland did not prove lasting, and by 1911 Harris was described as the union's organiser for the Belfast District.

After Irish independence, Harris was posted to South West England, where he served on the Cornwall Agricultural Wages Committee and chaired the Joint Industrial Committee for the china clay industry. The union sponsored Harris as a candidate in Penryn and Falmouth at the 1922 UK general election, and then in Plymouth Devonport at the UK general election, taking third place on each occasion.

Delicate Flowers

Delicate Flowers is an indie rock band from New Jersey.

Delicate Flowers is a four-piece indie rock and folk band from New Jersey, that formed in 2017. It consists of drummer Skylar Adler, bassist Frank DeFranco, guitarist and vocalist Eric Goldberg and guitarist Donnie Law. Delicate Flowers began as a solo project by Goldberg, writing "songs that were almost more poems than songs." They draw comparison to Conor Oberst, Sufjan Stevens, My Bloody Valentine and Silversun Pickups. Their first EP, the four-track "Delicate Flowers" was released by Sniffling Indie Kids on 6 October 2015, and it contains a cover of "Jesus Doesn’t Want Me For A Sunbeam." The lead single "Inherently a Drag" is about "not believing in anything and how that's a bummer but that at the same time, you can't really fool yourself." Speak Into My Good Eye describes the song as a "mature, world-weariness backed by atmospheric, jangly acoustic strums, echoed harmonies and a sense of hope springing up out of the uncertainty." The eight-track album "Happy Accidents" was released on 15 April 2016. Goldberg plays every instrument on the album. Bob Makin in "Courier News" calls it "strip[ped] down to an indie folk root," adding the song "Happy Accidents" "mines the kind of intelligent, witty, emotionally raw songwriting that has made Sufjan Stevens and the late Elliott Smith influences on many young artists."

Delicate Flowers performed at the 2017 North Jersey Indie Rock Festival. They also performed at the Secret Loft's Broken Records: Year One Anniversary! with LKFFCT, Shred Flintstone and Bueno on 17 August 2018. The album "Die Progress Unit I" was released by Sniffling Indie Kids on 2 November 2018, and the record release show was held that night at Stosh's in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, with LKFFCT, John Cozz and Toy Cars. The album is the first half of a two-part project that will culminate in the Spring of 2019. The opening track "Vessel" is described as "the finest moments of post-shoegaze and 90s grunge-pop[;] the song is simply impossible to ignore" by "Jersey Beat".

William Wallace (marine engineer)

Sir William Wallace CBE FRSE LLD (1881–1963) was a 20th-century Scottish marine engineer and influential businessman. He was Chairman of Brown Brothers for over 40 years, mainly involved in the technology behind ship construction rather than their design per sae. He was involved with ship design and technological advancement during both world wars, but his ideas were not always successful: including the ill-fated K-class submarines.

He was born in Leicester on 25 August 1881 the son of Matthew Wallace of Paisley. The family returned to Paisley in his youth and he was educated at Paisley Grammar School. From 1895 he was apprenticed as an engineer at Bow, McLachlan and Company at the Thistle Works at Abbotsinch. He also undertook formal training at Anderson College in Glasgow. He then joined the British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company as Chief Engineer.

In 1910 he joined Brown Brothers in Leith as an engineer. He originally lived in a small flat at 116 Easter Road. He rose extremely rapidly becoming Managing Director in 1916 aged only 35. He remained Managing Director until 1957 also becoming Chairman in 1947.

Considering that Brown Brothers was primarily involved in the design and creation of ship components it is unusual that their premises was not located at a dock or major river. Their huge complex stood linking Pilrig Street to Broughton Road, wrapping around Rosebank Cemetery. This is around a mile from Leith Docks. This "inconvenience" was probably the result of a ground-rent dispute, but gave them a later advantage in giving a very "secure" site in terms of new creations for warfare, commissioned by the government.

During the First World War he was involved with the design and building of the infamously ill-fated British K-class submarines. Due to this position as designer he was on board K 13 during its trials when she failed to surface during trials at the Gareloch on 29 January 1917. 32 people died in this incident, but 48 were rescued. Wallace's technical knowledge undoubtedly aided the survival of those rescued.

In the 1930s (with Maurice Denny) he developed the Denny-Brown stabilizer, first used on a cross-Channel ferry in 1936 and a popular choice in many Royal Navy ships during the Second World War. He was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1944 for services to the shipbuilding industry.

He later specialised in designing steering gear for the major liners such as the RMS Queen Mary (1934) and RMS Queen Elizabeth (1938).

In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Cameron Smail, Sir Ernest Wedderburn, Sir David Russell and John Barber Todd. He was knighted by King George VI in 1951.

In 1954 he was the second recipient of the Churchill Medal awarded to major figures of British engineering. Edinburgh University awarded him an honorary doctorate (LLD) in 1956.

He retired in 1959 after almost 50 years at Brown Brothers.

He died suddenly on 27 May 1963 aged 81.


In 1916 he married Christina Gilchrist Stewart.

Uroballus koponeni

Uroballus koponeni, is a species of spider of the genus "Uroballus". It is endemic to the Malaysian part of Borneo.

This species is closest to "Uroballus kinabalu". "U. koponeni" has different spermathecal chambers, longer spinnerets, and long abdominal hairs.

"U. koponeni" has been described from one female and two immatures, which were collected in 1987, by beating foliage in secondary forest in Kampong Kuap, near Kuching, Sarawak, Borneo.

The species is named after Finnish arachnologist Seppo Koponen, who turned 70 at the year of description.

The body of the female is about 3 mm long. The abdomen is unusually long, with a zebra-like pattern and transverse rows of dark long hairs.

The abdomen of the female is covered in dark long hears, becoming especially dense and long near at the rear end, and on the spinnerets. This species has the longest spinnerets of any "Uroballus", and indeed of any salticid. They are around half as long as the abdomen.

<doc id="60282369" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60282369" title="Denning (Munich)">
Denning (Munich)

Denning is a district of the Bavarian capital Munich and belongs to district 13 Bogenhausen.

Denning is located in the eastern part of the urban district Bogenhausen between "Englschalking" in the north and "Zamdorf" in the south. The historic city center was located at the intersection between the east-west axis formed by Denninger and Daglfinger Straße and the north-south axis formed by Friedrich-Eckart-Straße and Ostpreußenstraße. The borders of Denning are the Vollmannstraße in the west, the Memeler Straße in the north, the S-Bahn line in the east and the "Denninger Anger" in the south.

The Dennings area was settled in the Roman period, around about the end of the first to the middle of the third century. A testimony to the Roman past of Dennings is a 1928 excavated villa rustica with its own bathhouse.

In official documents, Denning was first mentioned in 1200 as "Tenningen" or "Danningen", which probably goes back to the personal name "Tenno".

Around 1800 Denning was a hamlet with four farms, of which only the "Alte Kernhof" is preserved today, and a chapel, the Guardian Angel Chapel. One of the courtyards and the Guardian Angel Chapel were demolished in the 1950s, the other two courtyards were demolished around the end of the 1970s, due to the relocation of the Daglfinger Straße.

When the village was incorporated into Bavaria in 1818, the hamlet Denning initially formed the independent municipality Zamdorf with Zamdorf and Steinhausen, which was incorporated in 1820 into the community Daglfing. An application of Dennings, to be converted to Bogenhausen, was rejected in 1873 by the competent authorities. At the end of the 19th century there were eight properties in Denning, to which the number of houses increased to 140 by 1930.

While the almost two-meter-thick layer of clay beneath a thin layer of humus was formerly used for agricultural purposes, it was mined in the 19th century for brick production for the rapidly growing construction industry in Munich. For example, the "Ludwigskirche" was built with the bricks burned in Denning. After the clay was exhausted, the pits were used for gravel extraction. As the last reminder of the gravel quarrying, the unused gravel plant stood on Denninger Straße until approx. 2000, more precisely on the Pühnstraße. Due to its dilapidated nature, however, it was demolished, so that today the area offers residents a place of recreation where nature could slowly but steadily recover.

The community Daglfing was incorporated on 1 January 1930 to Munich.

Even before the incorporation into Munich, the settlement activity began in 1924: East of today's Ostpreußenstraße to today's "Platz Zur Deutschen Einheit" (place for German unity) was the Obermaiersche colony, named after the lead contractor. From 1926 the Denning colony arose west of today's Ostpreußenstraße. At the end of the 1960s, the Denninger Straße-Warthestraße was built up with four to eight-story residential developments south of the Denninger Straße, which were also called "Denninger Hochhäuser" (Denninger skyscrapers) due to the otherwise lower development of Denning.

Dennings townscape today is characterized by residential areas with single-family homes, which are surrounded by gardens. Only in the settlement Denninger Straße-Warthestraße at the southern end of Dennings, are skyscrapers. The oldest remaining property in Denning is the restaurant "Alter Kernhof" on the corner of Ostpreußen-Denninger Straße.

The main axis in Dennings is the Ostpreußenstraße, in which there are more than 100 shops and service companies, including the houseware business "Mächtlinger", as one of the last in Munich where you can find everything needed in a home, from mousetraps to special screws. There are also eateries and a pub on Ostpreußenstraße.

Since the demolition of the Guardian Angel Chapel in 1953, there is no Roman Catholic church building in Denning. However, the Catholic parish church of St. Emmeram in the neighboring Englschalking district is located on the Ostpreußenstraße just a few meters from the border between the two districts. Also near this border, but on the Denninger side, is the Protestant-Lutheran Immanuel Church on the Memeler Straße.

In the core area of Denning there are only smaller parks such as that at "Posener Platz" or at the "Platz Zur Deutschen Einheit". Therefore, the "Denninger Anger" extends along the entire southern border of Denning, and in the west there is a green band in north-south direction. In the "Denninger Anger", at the Denninger Straße 190, the administrative building of the 1975 decommissioned Obermaier "Kiesquetschwerks" (plant to squeeze gravel) set a bit back from the road, is the last reminder that the clay mining area was later used for gravel mining. Until 2002, there were also parts of the actual squeezing plant located there.

John Forbes (Gaelic scholar)

Reverend John Forbes (1818-1863) was a minister of the Church of Scotland in Kilmore, Isle of Skye and a prominent Gaelic scholar. He is known for his work on the grammar of Scottish Gaelic, "A double grammar English and Gaelic".

John Forbes was born in Strathglass, in the North West Highlands of Scotland, in 1818. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and then worked as a teacher for several years. He was the schoolmaster of Fort Augustus in 1843 and one of the masters at the Normal Institute, Edinburgh in 1848. Between the years 1849 and 1851 he worked as an assistant at St Stephens in Edinburgh.

In 1851 he was presented to Queen Victoria, and also ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland. Forbes was minister in Kilmore, Sleat, on the Isle of Skye during a time of famine and poverty where he provided relief to his parishioners. He provided boys with an education and supported them in gaining entry to university. He retrieved young girls who had been lured to the mills in Manchester with false promises of well-paid work and wrote "Weeping in the Isles", an exposé of the death of two girls and testimony from other girls returned to Skye. He also did his best to suppress sexual impropriety on the island.

He married Jane Smith (d. 1874), whom he cut out of his will due to her alcohol consumption: "To my beloved wife personally I cannot entrust anything. Prudence and my sense of duty forbid it. I do it with grief and pain, because she has, during the last 18 years, proved herself utterly unworthy of trust or confidence, being unfortunately addicted to the vice of intemperance." They had one son, Alexander Robert, an assistant keeper of the Court of Session's minute book and Gaelic scholar who published "Gaelic names of beasts (mammalia), birds, fishes, insects, reptiles, etc." and "Place-names of Skye and adjacent islands". Forbes died on 21 January 1863 and is buried in the graveyard of the old parish church of Kilmore, Isle of Skye.

Forbes is the great great- great- great- grandfather of British actor and comedian David Mitchell. Their connection was explored on the television series Who do you think you are.

He was among one of the best Gaelic scholars of his time. He wrote books on Gaelic grammar and published Gaelic poetry. He also made several translations of works into Gaelic.

<doc id="60282509" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60282509" title="The Dream of Reality">
The Dream of Reality

The Dream of Reality: Heinz von Foerster's Constructivism is a book by Lynn Segal first published in 1986. Segal, a licensed clinical social worker, examines the constructivist epistemology of physicist and philosopher Heinz von Foerster. Originally intended as a transcription of von Foerster's lectures, the book evolved into Segal's interpretation of von Foerster's constructivism written in everyday language. 

The book begins with a foreward by Paul Watzlawick, a preface by the author, and an introduction which provides a synopsis of the book's content and structure. In chapter one, "The Myth of Objectivity", Segal introduces the objectivity vs. constructivist epistemology debate, illustrated with examples of making sense of undifferentiated sensory input and eigenvalue puzzles, where the the observer is necessary. In chapter two,"The Difficulties of Language", the author describes what we can learn about epistemology from syllogisms, paradox, self-reference, and causality, finally focusing on the circular causality described in cybernetics. In the third chapter, "Maturana and the Observer", Segal reviews Humberto Maturana's "observer-based science" where the object observed is not assumed to exist independent of the observer. "The Nervous System" is the next chapter, where Segal surveys the historical theories connecting perception and thought, including theories by Aristotle, Alkmaeon, Hippocrates, Galen, William Harvey, René Descartes, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal. In this chapter the author also looks at the evolution, structure, and function, of the nervous system and its relationship to the endocrine system. The fifth chapter, "Computation", examines how computation happens in both computers and brains, using formal logic and trivial and non-trivial logical machines as conceptual tools to distinguish the two. Humans have capacity to "compute" in additional domains beyond mathematical-logical, including sensory and semantic domains. In chapter six, "Biocomputation", Segal looks at how neural circuits work to calculate Boolean operations, and how these circuits fire in the presence of different but ignore sameness. In the final chapter, "Closure", the author looks at closure across thermodynamics, mathematics, systems theory, and autopoesis. Segal goes on to examine the double closure of the nervous system along its sensorimotor and synapitc-endocrine dimensions. He returns to mathematics to examine recursion theory, cognition, and solipsism. The book ends with an interview with Heinz von Foerster conducted by media studies professor Carol Wilder.

The first edition of the book was published in 1986 by W. W. Norton. A second edition of the book was published in 2001 by Springer with some corrections from von Foerster.

The book received both mixed and positive reviews from the mental health and academic communities. Psychiatrist Peter Bruggen, reviewing the book for the "Journal of Family Therapy", notes that Lynn's discussions around paradox, reality, and the role of the observer are easier to follow than other writers such as Bateson and Maturana, even if Lynn's logic is difficult to follow at times. Writing for "Contemporary Psychology", David E. Presti questions Segal's application of neuroscience principles to questions of epistemology, while Klaus Krippendorff reviewing for the "Journal of Communication" praises Segal's ability to clearly present von Foerster's ideas, even if the book doesn't explore counterarguments. Linda Ade-Ridder writes in her review for "Family Relations", "Written for anyone interested in exploring the concepts of objectivity and reality, this concise volume translates the ideas behind radical constructivism into a very readable form. Therapists will find the ideas particularly thought-provoking through the exploration of how language and logic shape thinking, especially within psychotheraputic models."

Die Progress Unit I

Die Progress Unit I is the second studio album by Delicate Flowers, released in 2018. 

The eight-track album was digitally released by Sniffling Indie Kids on 2 November 2018. It was recorded, mixed and mastered by Skylar Adler at Skylar Ross Recording, except for the drums, which were recorded by Erik Kase Romero at Lakehouse Recording Studios. The album cover photograph is by Sonja Wagner. "Die Progress Unit I" is the first half of a two-part project that will culminate in the Spring of 2019. A "Pirate!" press release describes the album as a "psychedelic space rock frenzy," and compares it to Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., My Bloody Valentine and Silversun Pickups. The band explains the single "Vessel," released on 3 October 2018, is about the "worth of being an artist in today's society is the message being portrayed through [their] art and the thrill of tapping in to that creative part of [their] brain." The albums second single "Killer They Send" released on 17 October 2018. The record release party for "Die Progress Unit I" was held on 2 November 2018 at Stosh's in Fair Lawn, New Jersey with LKFFCT, John Cozz and Toy Cars.

A review by Rich Quinlan in "Jersey Beat" says "Vessel" is an "incredible opener for "Die Progress", as it is a fuzzy, slow boil of a droning guitar powerhouse," adding "the track borrows heavily from the finest moments of post-shoegaze and 90s grunge-pop, and the song is simply impossible to ignore." He also says "many of the songs on "Die Progress Unit I" fly by briskly, only slightly touching the three-minute mark and often delivered with speed and charm."

Loan Syndications and Trading Association

The Loan Syndications and Trading Association (the "LSTA") is a financial services trade group which exists to enhance the development and running of the North American syndicated loan market.

The advent of private equity in the 1970s had not initially seen large scale bank or credit entity debt as an critical structural component, with early buyout practitioners such as Nicholas C. Forstmann placing emphasis on equity investment and a close, collaborate relationship with a company's management.. This, coupled with the industry's youth, served to contain PE investments to a comparatively small scale. However the large returns prompted new entrants to the sector. The expansion of the industry, along with the higher returns which could be earned by PE houses through employing debt in place of equity, created a market for a higher risk loan product; leveraged debt. This carried a higher risk profile than the investment grade corporate debt which had hitherto dominated corporate America.

The 1980s innovations in debt capital markets led by Michael Milken's pioneering of high yield bonds (then called 'junk bonds') served to give the industry further mass, as did certain key takeover events such as the $25bn 1988 takeover battle for RJR Nabisco]. Given the higher-risk profile of leveraged loans vis investment grade debt, original bank lenders would typically syndicate the debt, selling down some or all of their loans to other debt providers.

The LSTA was founded in New York City (the focus point for America's loan market) on 26 December 1995 as the Debt Traders Association, Inc., before changing its name on 28 June 1996 to the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, Inc. to serve as an industry association for the sector, and to enhance its running and advocate for its expansion. The LSTA's involvement in corporate debt is not solely limited to private equity, but corporate debt more generally.

The LSTA's mission statement is to ""promote a fair, orderly, efficient, and growing corporate loan market and provide leadership in advancing and balancing the interests of all market participants"".

For this purpose the LSTA publishes standardised precedent documents to be used in loan creation (as the Loan Market Association does for EMEA), provides training seminars, and engages in public relations.

The LSTA is headed by an Executive Director, currently Lee Shaiman. Its main governance body is the Board of Directors, comprising the main membership. The board is composed of members representing both private equity sponsors (albeit frequently through their credit arms) and lenders. As of March 2019 the Board is compromised of members representing the following concerns:

LSTA membership is both buy- and sell-side, compromising both lenders (traditionally banks, but now also credit funds) and sponsors, as well as auxiliary operators in the syndicated loan market such as professional services firms (for example PricewaterhouseCoopers), ratings agencies such as Fitch, and law firms active in the lending/private equity space (for instance Kirkland & Ellis and Clifford Chance). 

There are three classes of membership: full members, associate members, and affiliate members. Full and associate members are typically market participants, whilst associate members are entities which have a strong interest in the market but which are not themselves market participants, such as law firms.

The costs of the LSTA are borne by its membership. There are approximately 280 different members, all of them corporate or similar entities.

Parutyne

Parutyne () is a village of Ochakiv Raion, Mykolaiv Oblast, in Southern Ukraine. The village is a center of local rural community ("silrada").

On territory of the village are located ruins of the Ancient Greek polis Olbia.

The settlement was founded in 1789 at Parutyne balka (gulch) near location known "Sta Mohyl" (Hundreds burials) by former Nekrasov Cossacks–Lipovans who resettled here from Cioburciu (Chobruchi).

Following the Siege of Ochakov during the 1787–1792 Russo-Turkish War, in 1792 over 12,000 desiatinas (~32.5 thousands of acres) of land with Parutyne at the right bank of Boh liman (Southern Bug estuary) near Ochakiv were given by Catherine the Great to "Malorossian" landowner and son of former Cossack Hetmanate official, Count Illia Bezborodko.

After that Nekrassov Cossacks left Parutyne and returned back to Dniester banks, while Bezborodko resettled the area with own serfs primarily from Chernigov Governorate (former Cossack Hetmanate). The settlement was renamed as Ilyinske. During the 1795 revision in Ilyinske lived 324 males. At first the village belonged to Kherson county of Novorossiysk Governorate, and since 1827 to Odessa county of Kherson Governorate. In 1858 Ilyinske is mentioned in historical sources as a town (miestechko) which accounted for over 100 households (dvory - courts) with 864 serfs.

Sodium trifluoroacetate

Sodium trifluoroacetate is a chemical compound with a formula of CFCONa. It is the sodium salt of trifluoroacetic acid. It is used as a source of trifluoromethylations. 

With the pK of 0.23 for trifluoroacetic acid (compared to acetic acid, which has a pK of 4.76), the trifluoroacetate ion is clearly a much weaker base. This is because of the electron-withdrawing effect on the 3 fluorine atoms adjacent to the carbon atom. With strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, the trifluoroacetate ion can be protonated:

<chem>CF3CO2- + HCl -> CF3CO2H + Cl-
</chem>

<chem>CF3CO2- + H2SO4 -> CF3CO2H + HSO4-</chem>

It also partially reacts with hydronium cations to form the acid:

<chem>CF3CO2- + H3O+ <=» CF3CO2H + H2O</chem>

The equilibrium is not complete because of the smaller pK difference of the acid and hydronium. 

One convenient method is by dissolving an equivalent amount of sodium carbonate in 50% aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid. The solution is filtered and evaporated by vacuum evaporation (with special care to avoid decomposition of the salt by overheating). The solid obtained is dried under vacuum at 100 °C. 

Sodium trifluoroacetate is a useful reagent for trifluoromethylation.

Ghana–Hungary relations

Ghana–Hungary relations refers to the current and historical relations between Ghana and Hungary.

The Hungarian People's Republic was one of the first countries to acknowledge Ghana's independence, the first official Hungarian trade delegation visited the African country in August 1959. During the Cold War, Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah gradually became affiliated with the Soviet Union following hist ideological turn towards "African socialism" and his confrontation with the Western Bloc in the Congo Crisis. Nkrumah made a two-month round-trip in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc (including Yugoslavia and China too) in the summer of 1961, during which he visited Hungary from 28 to 31 July. Nkrumah met Hungarian head of state István Dobi, then Secretary-General János Kádár. Nkrumah also visited the Beloiannisz Electric Equipment Factory (BHG). There, Hungarian politician Károly Kiss emphasized the similarity of the two countries' historical past and their fight against imperialist colonists.

Simultaneously with Nkrumah's visit, Hungary opened its embassy in Accra on 29 July 1961. The first ambassador Péter Kós presented his credentials to Nkrumah on 13 December 1961. Ghana also established its embassy in Budapest, "chargé d'affaires" R. N. N. Laryea arrived to Hungary in January 1962. The first ambassador J. G. Amamoo presented his credentials to István Dobi on 7 March. During his appointment, the 28-year-old diplomat was the youngest ambassador in the world. A Hungarian delegation of economic experts, led by József Bognár, a former Mayor of Budapest, were invited to Ghana to work on the First Seven-Year Plan. The team spent two months in Ghana in early 1962.

After the 1966 coup in Ghana, the relationship had gradually deteriorated between the two countries. Hungary closed its embassy on 15 December 1987.

<doc id="60282944" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60282944" title="1971 Yugoslav Embassy shooting">
1971 Yugoslav Embassy shooting

The 1971 Yugoslav Embassy shooting () was a shooting at the Yugoslavian Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden on 7 April 1971. The perpetrators were two Croats linked to the post-World War II Ustashe movement that operated in parts of Europe such as Germany, England and Sweden where they committed murder and carried out bombings and other assaults. At the event, Ambassador Vladimir Rolović was injured. He later died from his injuries.

On 10 February 1971, two Yugoslav men entered the Yugoslav Consulate in Gothenburg. They gathered and tied all people to the premises and threatened them with knives and guns. They gathered the staff, tied up all the people in the premises and threatened them with knives and guns. The two men, Blago Mikulic and Ivan Vujicevic, demanded that the Yugoslav authorities release the convicted Miljenko Hrkać who was imprisoned in Yugoslavia and that he be brought to the Franco-controlled Spain with $20,000 in his pocket. If the demands were not met, the employees of the consulate would be executed. After just over one day's siege and fruitless negotiations with the Swedish police, they gave up and were arrested. Blago and Vujicevic, who belonged to the organization "Jadran", or the Black Legion, were later sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The Yugoslav ambassador to Stockholm, Vladimir Rolović, was upset in the media and said that the Swedish police should take the terrorist threat more seriously. He claimed that the Croatian separatists belonged to Ustashe, an organization that collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. The Croatian assailants then came to be called Ustashe in popular terms.

A few months later, on 7 April 1971, at the Yugoslav Embassy on Strandvägen in Stockholm, Miro Barešić and Anđelko Brajković penetrated the building and took the ambassador Vladimir Rolović (a former OZNA colonel), hostage. He was struck across the face with a pistol and dragged into his room. The men tied Rolović to a chair, pulled a leather belt around his neck and shot him in the face and stomach. Several shots were fired, one penetrated a door and injured the embassy secretary, Mira Stempilhar. One of the men urinated Rolovic's blood from his hands, the other threw a portrait of Tito through the window. An embassy officer who tried to escape through a window was taken to the hospital. When the police arrived, they immediately stormed the building and forced the terrorists to surrender. The ambassador was shot dead in a pool of blood on the floor. Barešić and Brajković stood in a corner with their hands in the air. On their way out of the building, they shouted "Long live the Independent State of Croatia" and "long live Ante Pavelić”. Barešić and Brajković said they belong to Ustashe and also proclaimed that he wanted to punish Rolović for his visit to Canberra, Australia, where he was sent by the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry to inform the Australian Government of the Ustashe members who prepared terrorist actions in Yugoslavia from its territory.

Rolović died a week later without regaining consciousness at Karolinska Hospital. The Yugoslav secret service has always maintained that Ante Stojanov, who was convicted by Stockholm District Court for complicity to murder, was in fact the mastermind behind the attack and aircraft hijacking, which Stoyanov later admitted. He supervised the operation from a bar on Strandvägen. Ante Stojanov, was convicted of complicity to murder of the Yugoslav ambassador, while his then twenty-year-old cousin Miro Barešić along with Anđelko Brajković were convicted to life imprisonment. Stojanov and the other two assailants, Marinko Lemo and Stanislav Milicevic, was sentenced in the same trial to between two and four years in prison and deportation. The Swedish government was now under heavy pressure. The Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito immediately sent his Deputy Foreign Minister to Sweden. A furious Milorad Pesic was met at the airport by the State Secretary Thage G. Peterson. During the journey towards Stockholm and the waiting Prime Minister Olof Palme, a shocked Peterson was told how the Deputy Minister demanded that the arrested should be cut into pieces. He wanted them to be executed in Sweden as soon as possible or at least to be taken to Yugoslavia to be killed.

What did not appear in the Swedish police investigation in 1971 was that the kidnapping of Rolović was not the goal of the attack on the Yugoslav Embassy. The Swedish-Croatian journalist Tonči Percan showed, after a thorough examination of the archive material in Stockholm 45 years later, and after talking with the mastermind behind the attack Ante Stojanov, that it really was an act of revenge. Rolović was to be executed. In 1969, the Yugoslavian agent Ilija Stanić had murdered the Ustashe general Vjekoslav Luburić in Spain. After World War II, Luburić had fled to Spain, where he was active in the Croatian National Resistance, and the State Security Administration (UDBA) pursued an intensive search for Croatian nationalists around the world. The attack in Stockholm was a revenge for the murder of Luburić. Before Rolović was murdered, Barešić had placed a photo of Ilija Stanić on the ambassador's desk; It was a message to UDBA and Tito. The revenge was completed.

The first and so far only aircraft hijacking in Sweden, that of the Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 130 took place at Bulltofta Airport on 15 September 1972. It was hijacked because the six Croats who were imprisoned for murder of Yugoslav ambassador Rolović in Stockholm in 1971 would be released. The aircraft hijacking was already planned before the attack on the Yugoslav Embassy. Stojanov said in an interview in 2004 that if they were to get caught, their comrades would get them free by hijacking an airplane. Three Croatian men, Tomislav Rebrina (36), Nicola Lisac (44) and Rudolf Prskalo (29), from the fascist Ustashe movement held 86 passengers and 4 crew members hostage. The end was that six of the detained terrorists who were taken to Malmö were exchanged for hostages to be released. The hijackers also received half a million Swedish crowns, which they demanded. A seventh of those involved in the ambassador's murder refused to come along. The plane took off and flew to Madrid. The hijackers and their comrades were arrested and received extremely symbolic punishments - rather protection - in Spain which was then a fascist dictatorship under Francisco Franco. They were eventually released and scattered across the world. Some returned to Croatia in connection with the breakup of Yugoslavia.

After the release from a Spanish prison, Barešić lived a flattering life for several years. He worked for a couple of years under a false name as bodyguard for Paraguay's president Alfredo Stroessner. When he arrived in the United States in 1979, he was disclosed and extradited to Sweden. Again, he created headlines when he repeatedly hunger striked to get his life sentence timed and avoid solitary confinement. In 1985, the sentence was converted to 18 years in prison and in 1987 Barešić was able to leave Österåker Prison where he served his last time of the sentence. He was deported from Sweden to Paraguay. From there he finally returned to Croatia. Barešić was killed in action in July 1991, but the Croatian government kept his death secret for over a year so that the moral of the Croatian Army would not sink. He was appointed posthumously to general. also returned to Croatia and retired as colonel after the war.

Both in connection with the murder of ambassador Rolović and after the aircraft hijacking, the diplomatic situation between Sweden and Yugoslavia was tense. Many Yugoslavians argued that the Swedish government should never have released the Croatian terrorists. The two attacks also caused great concern among the many Yugoslav immigrants in Sweden. However, as a result of the murder of Rolovic, the punishment for unlawful weapons possession and arms crimes in Sweden was tightened. In 1973, the much talked about terrorist law was passed, which gave the Swedish Security Service (Säpo) greater authority. Among other things, Säpo was now able to leagally bug suspects phones and open their mail. The law also gave Säpo the right to expel a foreign citizen "with regard to what is known about the foreigner's previous activities".

Stojanov told an interviewer in 2004 that he considered the ambassador's murder and aircraft hijacking as the start of the Croatian struggle for independence.

Mossberg 9200

The Mossberg 9200 is a 12-gauge semi-automatic series of shotguns designed by O.F. Mossberg & Sons that was made until 2001.

The Mossberg 9200 series of shotguns are autoloading, gas-operated shotguns. Consistent with all Mossberg shotguns, this model series has the same ambidextrous thumb-operated safety switch positioned in the middle of the receiver. The Mossberg 9200 series uses 2¾" or 3" Magnum shells except for the 9200A1 which was specifically designed to use 2¾" Magnum rounds.

Two main versions were made: the 9200 and the 9200A1. The 9200 was a general platform with several grades of finish and features and primarily intended for hunting and sport shooting. In 2000, Mossberg produced a version called 9200A1 or "Jungle Gun" which was specifically designed to US military specifications and submitted for review to replace the existing shotguns used by the military. The 9200A1 was not chosen. 

Variants of the 9200 include Crown Grade and Viking. Additionally, until 1998, Mossberg also sold a "Persuader" model under their "Special Purpose" line which had a more rugged finish and synthetic stock.

Penrhiw Priory was originally built as a vicarage in Britain’s smallest city, St Davids in 1884.. The building changed ownership multiple times and in 1960's it was extended extensively and became the first priory in the community and serve for the mission of St John the Evangelist . In 2008 The Retreats Group Trust brought the the building and commissioned Acanthus Holden Architects to design and manage the transformation of the building into a 5* luxury hotel . Then in 2012, Penrhiw Priory reopened as a luxury eight-bedroom hotel meticulously restored along with Roch Castle and Twr y Felin Hotel, by the Griffiths Roch Foundation, which was set up in 2009 by international architect Keith Griffiths.

Nestled within acres of private gardens enveloped by woodland paths, river and meadow, Penrhiw is only a short walk into St Davids and the nearby Pembrokeshire Coast Path. In St Davids itself the 6 century St Davids Cathedral and Bishop’s Palace can be found within the valley.

Penrhiw Priory’s Garden Bedroom is the bedroom of the vicar who was placed here by the Church in Wales in 1882 to stem the migration to non-conformist chapels. The stables housed his horses and carriage to enable him to reach the parishioners to entice them back to the church. The Coach House now house Meadow Suite on the ground floor and Court, above on the first floor.
